# Japanese Chatbot
An interactive chatbot that helps users learn Japanese through free-form translation, grammar correction, and conversation. Instead of relying on a fixed knowledge base, it uses pretrained NLP models to dynamically translate words, phrases, and sentences, correct grammar mistakes, and respond to user messages in Japanese.

# Features
* Free-form translation: Ask "how do you say dog in Japanese?"
* Grammar correction: Type "Can you fix this sentence", provide the sentence (e.g. 東京に行きたいだ) and the bot suggests corrections (e.g. 東京に行きたい)
* Conversation Mode: Type "let's have a conversation" for  speaking practice.
